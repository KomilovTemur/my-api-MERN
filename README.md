## Task
Build a backend project providing an API.

## Description
I got help from internet manuals and my friends.

## Installation
No, you don't have to, just follow the link.

## Usage
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.
